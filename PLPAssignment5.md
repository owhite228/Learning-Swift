Swift supports both classes and structures. Classes and structures are very similar, but classes have an added layer of complexity. 
The standard is to use structs whenever possible, and only use classes when absolutely necessary. 
Both struct and class names should be captitalized, and they both can have objects.


Swift has some standard class/struct methods including get and set, but they are very complicated and I don't really understand them at all.

How does inheritance work (if it does)? Does your language support multiple inheritance?

If there is inheritance, how does your language deal with overloading method names and resolving those calls?

Is there anything else that’s important to know about objects and inheritance in your language?
  I know this question is vague, but objects are were languages can vary a lot, so it’s hard to ask questions that will apply to everyone.
